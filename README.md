that can be customized with a threshold, max length etc.

## Features

- Fancy password input field
- Visual complexity slider and controls
- Forms compatibility

## Description

This is an input component that will work inside a form. Basically, it's a very
styled `<input type="password">`, with a little bar that shows complexity of
your password.

This component is also compatible with forms.

## Instructions
